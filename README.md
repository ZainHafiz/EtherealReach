# EtherealReach
A repository for a 2D Platformer game that I am working on.

This game is called Ethereal Reach, meaning a quest to attain something above this mortal realm. There currently is only one level however I will add more in the future. This is my first game and I've only been working on it for a few weeks so it isn't too complicated. In terms of Gameplay, it is reminiscent of a typical platformer in terms of its level design and controls. With instant kill spikes, suspended platforms, coins, and enemies, to name a few. A slightly more advanced feature is the ability to interact with certain objects in the world. In terms of graphics, I used the pixel art Metroidvania asset pack from o_lobster and another asset pack for the player. I designed the title screen logo by myself though. 

Controls:
a/d or left/right arrow key to move left/right
s or down arrow key to crouch
space to jump
left mouse button to attack with sword
E to interact with objects
