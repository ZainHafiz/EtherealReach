# EtherealReach
A repository for a mini 2D platformer game I created on Unity with C#.

This game is called Ethereal Reach, meaning a quest to attain something from beyond this world. This game demonstrates the effort I put into creating a movement system which is functional and smooth. This is my first game, so it acts more as a proof of concept. Regarding Gameplay, the game is reminiscent of a typical platformer in terms of its level design and controls. With instant kill spikes, suspended platforms, coins, and enemies, to name a few. A slightly more advanced feature is the ability to interact with certain objects, such as signs. Regarding graphics, I used the pixel art Metroidvania asset pack from o_lobster and another asset pack for the player. I designed the title screen logo myself. To open the game, you will need to download the Unity engine, and then open the 2D Game folder in the application. 

Controls:
- A/D or left/right arrow key to move left/right
- S or Down arrow key to crouch. It is possible to move left/right while crouching
- Space to jump
- Left mouse button to attack with sword
- E to interact with objects
